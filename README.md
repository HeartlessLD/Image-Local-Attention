# Image Local Attention: a Better PyTorch Implementation

## Introduction

Attention is widely used in deep learning now. Given a query and a collection of key-value pairs, the output of an attention module is the weighted sum of all values. The weights are obtained based on the similarities between the query and keys which are usually measured by their inner products. However, when the number of keys is large, it is expensive to apply such a module.

Researchers consider local attention to address this problem. That is a small subset of keys is involved given a query. For images, "local" means an image region around a pixel. Image local attention achieves great success on image restoration tasks. However, current implementations are based on the `im2col` operation which is memory expensive especially when the local patch is large.

## Implementation

Here, queries **Q**, keys **K** and value **V** are represented in `CHW` (channel, height, width) tensors. They are generated by convolutions. And "local region" is a `CKK` sub tensor where `K` is the size of a patch. Current implementations are based on the following steps:

* rearrange **K** and **V** to `KKCHW` tensors via `im2col`.
* compute similarity matrix **W** between **Q** and **K**: `KKHW`.
* output **O** is the sum of **V** weighted by **W**: `CHW`.

Clearly, the first step requires `KK` times memory to store **K** and **V**. However, this can be avoided. In our implementation, we compute **W** without rearranging keys and values. To this end, we write two CUDA kernels to compute **W** and **O**. And we build a PyTorch extension based on them. *Our implementation reduces the GPU memory by an order of magnitude and it is faster compared with the plain PyTorch implementations*.


## Install and usage

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Requirements:

```
PyTorch >= 1.4.0
CUDA >= 10.0
```

We write the Python warper in `function.py`.  Here is an example:

```python
import torch
from function import LocalAttention

# kH and kW for local patch size
# works only on GPU
module = LocalAttention(inp_channels=3, out_channels=16, kH=7, kW=7).cuda()
x = torch.rand(32, 3, 64, 64).cuda()

# Q, K, V are generated by convolutions of x
y = module(x)
```


## Performance

We evaluate the memory and speed of our implementation compared with the plain PyTorch implementation. The first table show performance for forward pass. The second table show over-all performance for forward-backward loop.
